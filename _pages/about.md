I'm a student at the University of Central Florida and member of its C3 team. If you're reading this, it's most likely because you are from another school trying to snope around. Sorry bucko, but this is just a demo blog that I made for a class ;)

Outside of Cybersecurity I am passionate about self-improvement (no matter how much I struggle with it), hanging out with friends, and maxxing out my typing speed. Fun fact, I'm top 30 in the world on monkeytype.com with a verified score of 227WPM on the 1 minute test.
